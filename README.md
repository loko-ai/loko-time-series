# loko-time-series


This projects, developed in Python, create some [LoKo AI](https://github.com/loko-ai/loko/tree/development) extensions that helps with **Time Series Forecasting**: thanks to the **TimeSeries** component you can train your model, make prediction and test evaluation, with the possibility to save the evaluation metrics in a file. This component works similarly to the Predictor component.



### TimeSeries GUI
It's possible to use the **TimeSeries GUI** to *create* or *delete* your own **Transformer**, **Model** and **Predictors**. Once you have a TimeSeries predictor you can also choose to *export* it, obtaining a zip file, or eventually *import* a TimeSeries predictor that you previously created.
